                        Ideally, you should introduce your products or services
                        to a young and fast-growing market. In more mature
                        sectors, you will need a competitive advantage in order
                        to distinguish yourself, i.e. product or service
                        innovation, great customer service, or the right price
                        point.

                        That means you should use a specialized research company
                        to help you first gather as much information as you can
                        to define your potential market, such as your
                        competitors' strengths and weaknesses and the
                        development time required to get your product off the
                        ground. Keep in mind that during this time, you will not

                        People on your management team should have skills that
                        complement one another. The best leaders ensure that
                        they recruit the top experts for each area of
                        operations. You should not be afraid to hire people who
                        have, in their respective fields, more expertise than
                        you do.

                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text">
                        You should also look at your outside resources as a part
                        of your team. From a practical point of view, you will
                        need technicians, sales people and managers, a lawyer,
                        an accounting firm, as well as marketing or public
                        relations help.

                        If you don't have the resources to set up a board of
                        directors, you can also opt for a strategy committee and
                        invite an expert to act as a sounding board for your
                        business decisions. In advanced technology, there are
                        more and more incubators that offer a wide range of
                        assistance for increasing your chances of success.

                        about hiring marketing specialists at the outset.
                        Marketing, while often neglected, is critical to the

                        Avoid fire-fighting and losing sight of your long-term
                        objectives. Make a list of all the factors you have to
                        consider in the immediate and medium term, especially if
                        you foresee rapid growth. To help you manage that
                        growth, you need to examine all available options, such
                        as purchasing or leasing premises, furniture and
                        equipment. You might also consider outsourcing different
                        operations, such as human resources, rather than
                        handling it internally.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text m-0">
                        Down the road, you will have to consider growth factors,
                        such as energy and resources, raw materials, salaries,
                        financing and technological needs. If you have carefully
                        assessed your growth potential, it's acceptable to think
                        big. For example, if you are positioned in a niche
                        market, you may not be profitable unless you start
                        exporting. To get a better idea of your exporting
                        potential, check with national, provincial, and regional
                        export support services such as those offered by
                        Canadian trade commissions in other countries.

                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text">
                        Start-ups are often financed by the savings of their
                        founders (as well as the savings of families and
                        friends). In many cases, it may be necessary to look for
                        outside capital such as Angels (private investors),
                        venture capital funds, assistance funds, or social
                        economy funding agencies.

                        Be sure you do your homework and know what investors
                        expect from you. A businessperson who invests in
                        companies once said, "If you knock on a door
                        prematurely, you run the risk of it being closed to you
                        later, particularly at the time when you are really
                        ready to enter it."

                        Most companies take time to get established, which means
                        there will be periods when business is slower. The key
                        is to make good use of that down time by networking, for
                        example. Three networking strategies that may be
                        appropriate, depending on your situation, are:

                        There are many rules, some very technical, which are
                        absolute requirements for your company's continued
                        existence. For instance, you must decide what legal form
                        your business will take, design an accounting system,
                        and comply with regulations covering labour practices,
                        occupational health and safety, and training.

                        In business and industry, you can start a company in
                        your own name. A group can form a registered partnership
                        or an incorporated company with a different set of
                        rules, privileges and responsibilities. If you have
                        several partners, you should draw up a shareholders'
                        agreement to define a mutual code of conduct. Or you
                        could decide to form a cooperative or not-for-profit
                        organization.

                        Be sure that your business plan incorporates all of the
                        above. Your plan must be concise, specific, and describe
                        your business project accurately. Write it yourself, as
                        it is your vision. And expect to do several rewrites
                        before you achieve your final plan. Don't be afraid to
                        get assistance if you need it. Show it to experts, such
                        as accountants and lawyers or to other experienced
                        entrepreneurs. Keep in mind that a business plan is more
                        than an accounting document; it must sell your idea to a
                        potential financial institution.
